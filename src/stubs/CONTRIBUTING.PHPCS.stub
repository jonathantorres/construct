- You __MUST__ use [feature / topic branches](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows) to ease the merge of contributions.

- You __MUST__ use the provided [commit message template]({git_message_path}), which follows the [rules](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) described by Chris Beams. It can be configured via `composer configure-commit-template` prior to committing.
